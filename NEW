This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.12) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

* speed up fibonacci():
  + by not making the argument a BigInt
  + caching a few more numbers
  + removing a few needless scalar computations
* fix bug in fibonacci() missing a few intermidiate results
* euler() just uses BigInt's fast bexp() method and is thus now MUHC faster
