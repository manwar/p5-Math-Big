This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.06) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

* fixed some nits in Math::BigInt::Constant and added tests
* split up and Math:Roman
* fibonacci() uses an ultra-fast conquer-divide algorithmn to calculate the
  result and is many times faster than the old version
