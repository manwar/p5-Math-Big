This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.07) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

* fixed typo in doc spotted by Mark Overmeer
* removed some left-over debug printouts, whoops
* documented that Math::BigInt::bfac() is faster than Math::Big::factorial()
* broke out Math::BigInt::Constant to extra package
